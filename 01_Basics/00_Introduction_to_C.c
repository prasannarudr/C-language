/** Computer languages: 

Computer languages are formal systemsdesigned to communicate instructions to acomputer.
Essential for software development, computerlanguages serve as the foundation 
for creating applications, websites, and various softwaresolutions.

Types of Computer Languages:
1) High-level languages: These languages are more abstract, making them 
   easier for humans to understand and write. 
   Use- from web development to artificial intelligence.
   Ex- Python, Java.

2) Low-level languages: Closer to machine language, provide more direct control over hardware.
Use- crucial for tasks that require precise control over hardware resources.
Ex- Assembly , C and Machine Code.

3) Scripting languages: Interpreted languages used for automating tasks 
and enhancing web development.
Use- integral to web development, automation, and the creation of dynamic content.
Ex- JavaScript and PHP

Compiler: A Compiler serves as a translator, converting High-Level 
Languageinput into low-level language. It transforms programming 
language codes into machine code.

Interpretor: The interpreter converts high-level language to an intermediate language. 
An Interpreter works line by line on a code.

WHAT IS C?
